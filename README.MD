## Project Organisation
- For each namespace that types and functions are contained within, create a folder. E.g. the structure `Game::GameSystem` will go in include/Game/GameSystem.h.
- The exception is only when adding extra folders becomes useless, for example having to add multiple folders that are empty, you can instead opt for creating a header file with the namespace's definitions inside.
